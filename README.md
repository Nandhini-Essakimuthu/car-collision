# car-collision
The provided Python script conducts a detailed analysis of a dataset related to car crashes in Monroe County spanning the years 2003 to 2015. Leveraging popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, matplotlib, and Seaborn, the script explores various dimensions of the dataset to uncover insights and trends associated with collision occurrences.

The script begins by loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame and performs initial data cleaning, transforming the 'Weekend?' column into a numeric format for subsequent analysis. Descriptive statistics are presented to offer a quick overview of the dataset.

Data visualization is a crucial aspect of the analysis, and the script includes a histogram showcasing the distribution of collisions by hour, providing a visual representation of when collisions are most likely to occur.

A temporal analysis follows, breaking down collision counts by year, month, and day to discern patterns and variations over time. The script also delves into the distinction between weekends and weekdays, examining how collision types differ during these periods.

Furthermore, the analysis explores the relationship between collision types and injury types, primary factors contributing to collisions, and the geographic distribution of collisions based on reported location, latitude, and longitude.

Geospatial analysis adds another layer of insight, plotting collision locations on a scatter plot to represent spatial patterns visually.

Correlation analysis checks the relationship between different variables, and a heatmap is employed to present a more intuitive view of the association between collision types and injury types.

Seasonal analysis categorizes collisions into seasons, offering insights into how collision patterns may vary throughout the year. While a placeholder suggests the intent to analyze road conditions, the corresponding code for this analysis is not yet provided.

The script concludes with a heatmap visualizing the intricate relationships between collision types, primary factors, and reported locations. The visualizations throughout the script enhance the interpretability of the findings and provide a comprehensive understanding of the car crash dataset. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of considering various factors, such as time, location, and contributing factors, in analyzing and understanding collision data.
